### 문제 설명

<p>The world financial crisis is quite a subject. Some people are more relaxed while others are quite anxious. John is one of them. He is very concerned about the evolution of the stock exchange. He follows stock prices every day looking for rising trends. Given a sequence of numbers p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub> representing stock prices, a rising trend is a subsequence p<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub> < p<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub> < ... < p<sub>i<sub>k</sub></sub>, with i<sub>1</sub> < i<sub>2</sub> < · · · < i<sub>k</sub>. John’s problem is to find very quickly the longest rising trend.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of stock prices. A data set starts with the length L (L ≤ 100000) of the sequence of numbers, followed by the numbers (a number fits a long integer). The program prints the length of the longest rising trend.</p>

<p>White spaces can occur freely in the input. The input data are correct and terminate with an end of file. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output from the beginning of a line</p>
