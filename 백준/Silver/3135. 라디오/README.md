### 문제 설명

<p>Slavko is driving his new Karambol GT20 car with a top-of-the-line radio (which, of course, Slavko made himself in his basement, next to the laundry washer). </p>

<p>Slavko's radio is very hi-tech and is equipped with two buttons that are used to manually change the frequency, and several buttons that change the frequency to one of the predefined frequencies. More precisely: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The first button increases the frequency by 1 (one) MHz; </li>
	<li>The second button decreases the frequency by 1 (one) MHz; </li>
	<li>Each of the remaining N buttons changes the frequency to one of the N predefined frequencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your job is to write a program that, given two frequencies A and B, computes the smallest number of button presses needed to change the frequency from A to B. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B < 1000, A ≠ B). </p>

<p>The second line of input contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5). </p>

<p>The following N lines contain the predefined frequencies (one integer per line, each less than 1000). </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the smallest number of button presses needed to change the frequency from A to B. </p>
