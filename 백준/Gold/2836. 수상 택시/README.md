<p>In the far away land there is a big river and a number of villages beside it. Villages are numbered 0 through M, in order along the river. Distance between consecutive villages is exactly 1 mile. </p>

<p>Mirko lives in the village marked with 0. He is in the business of transporting people between villages with his boat. Today, Mirko will travel from his village to village M, and he will also transport some people along the way. </p>

Mirko will, as always, start from his village 0, pick up A at village 2, pickup B at 6, go back to 4 and leave B there, proceed to village 8, leave A there, and then continue to his final destination, village M. This scenario is given in the first test case below. </p>

<p>Write a program that will find the minimum number of miles that Mirko must travel in order to transport everyone to their destinations and reach village M at the end. </p>
